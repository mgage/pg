##DESCRIPTION
#
#
# tests multiplying a matrix by a large scalar inside BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT
# if the scalar is large enough this fails in the presence of texStrings because
# the tex description of $c*$m becomes 1.3\times 10^{6}*\left[\begin{array}{cc}
# 1 &2\cr
# 3 &4
# \end{array}\right] 
# which can't be
